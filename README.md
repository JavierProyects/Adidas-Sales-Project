# Adidas-Sales-Projectüëüüíº 
üìä Excited to share the results of my recent Adidas sales project! I analyzed sales data from the past year and uncovered some fascinating insights. 

üîç Project Overview:
Using data from Adidas sales transactions, I conducted a comprehensive analysis to understand sales performance across different states, retailers, seasons, and sales methods. The goal was to identify trends, patterns, and opportunities to optimize sales strategies. 

Questions to consider:

1 - Which retailer would be the most strategic partner for Adidas in maximizing profits?
2 - Which is the best sales method? Why?
3 - Do seasonal variations significantly impact Adida's sales volume? How do different seasons affect consumer purchasing behavior?
4 - In which states are Adidas shoes more popular?
5 - Which month does Adidas get more revenue? Why?

üìà Key Findings:

1 - West Gear leads in total units sold, with 619,822 units, followed by Footlocker with 569,451 and Sports Direct with 553,494. Here most of us will think that West Gear is the best choice for Adidas to partner with. However, considering the profit margin, Sports Direct outshines the rest of the retailers by 40.737%. After a few calculations, the most profitable retailer is Sports Direct with a net profit of $225,476.851, followed by West Gear with $218,543.309, and Footlocker with $208,851.849.

2 - The bar chart illustrating different Sales Methods shows that online sales lead with 927,439 units sold, highlighting the popularity of online shopping. Outlet sales follow with 821,339 units. In-store sales come next with 672,766 units. Overall, online sales outperform other channels due to factors such as accessibility, convenience, and broader reach.

3 - Summer emerges as the peak season with approximately 29.1% of total sales, indicating a strong correlation between warmer weather and consumer purchasing behavior. The rest of the seasons contribute with a similar share ranging from 23.3% to 24.3%, this suggests that Adidas is effectively capitalizing on consumer demand throughout the year.

4 - California is the top-performing state with a total of 162,260 units sold, reflecting its large population and strong consumer market. 

5 - Adidas generates the highest revenue in July, one potential reason could be the summer season, which typically coincides with increased consumer spending on outdoor activities and apparel.
